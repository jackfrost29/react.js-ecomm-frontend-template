# React.js ecommerce frontend template using react.js, deepseek and ai prompt.
This is a ecommerce template for clothing/appareals/fashion wears built using react.js. The project was initiated with experimental mindset and has following properties.
1. The application is react.js based.
2. The source code is generated using "DeepSeek" AI agent.
3. The generated website is frontend only.
4. The generated app uses dummy/placeholder data wherever necessary.
5. The App has minimum business logic wherever necessary. The required business logic was left blank for hardcoding later according to the stakeholder requirement.
6. The App uses react router to handle all routes in the frontend without any interference from backend. Details about routes can be fount in the prompt file.
7. The Philosophy behind the project was "Using AI to ease the life of a software Developer", so that help could have been taken from AI agent to build all the UI/CSS to give the developer a headstart.
8. The {prompt.txt} file contains the prompt text used to generate the app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
