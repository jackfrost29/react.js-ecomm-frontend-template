# React.js ecommerce frontend template using react.js, deepseek and ai prompt.
This is a ecommerce template for clothing/appareals/fashion wears built using react.js. The project was initiated with experimental mindset and has following properties.
1. The application is react.js based.
2. The source code is generated using "DeepSeek" AI agent.
3. The generated website is frontend only.
4. The generated app uses dummy/placeholder data wherever necessary.
5. The App has minimum business logic wherever necessary. The required business logic was left blank for hardcoding later according to the stakeholder requirement.
6. The App uses react router to handle all routes in the frontend without any interference from backend. Details about routes can be fount in the prompt file.
7. The Philosophy behind the project was "Using AI to ease the life of a software Developer", so that help could have been taken from AI agent to build all the UI/CSS to give the developer a headstart.

### Incomplete (source code will be uploaded later at the earliest convenience).
